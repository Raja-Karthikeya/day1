        <p>The BMW M 1000 RR is the superbike homologated for racing. It was perfected in the wind tunnel and further developed on the circuit. It has optimised aerodynamics and uses carbon, resulting in a significantly higher top speed of 314 km/h. Its engine and chassis remain as powerful and direct as ever. The BMW M 1000 RR stands for absolute performance and exclusivity down to the last detail. Just the typical M.</p>
